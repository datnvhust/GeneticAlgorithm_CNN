# GeneticAlgorithm_CNN
Tuning the hyperparameters of a CNN using GA.

Algorithm to tune the hyperparameters of a CNN: Convultional Layers Size, Dropout Size, Optimizers and Learning Rate. The optimizantion was done by using genetic algorithm. 
The base implementation for this work was taken on the book Python Deep Learning CookBook.
